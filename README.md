# RAK - Rust ARM Kernel

## Why

Wanted to learn bare metal developement in Rust.
Originally started for raspberry, but only runs on qemu virt.

## Inspired from

- https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os
- https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials

# Next todo

- Needs global mutable variables for drivers. Need to implement some kind of mutex
